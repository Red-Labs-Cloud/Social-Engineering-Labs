## Tools


### GoPhish
A powerful and popular open-source phishing framework. You'll use it to create and launch phishing campaigns, track user interactions, and gather credentials.
### EvilGinx
Essential for sophisticated phishing attacks. It allows you to create convincing fake login pages that capture credentials while relaying traffic to the legitimate site, making it hard for users to detect the attack.
### Modlishka
Another excellent tool for reverse proxy phishing. It's known for its ability to bypass 2FA, making it highly effective against even security-conscious targets.
### Muraena
Similar to EvilGinx, Muraena is a flexible and easy-to-use phishing tool. Explore both and see which one fits your workflow better.
### EvilnoVNC
This allows you to embed a VNC server within a phishing page. When a victim interacts with the page, it can give you remote control of their machine (if they accept the VNC prompt) - very powerful but use with extreme caution and only in ethical hacking scenarios.
